# event-store-go [![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/im-tollu/event-store-go.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/github/im-tollu/event-store-go/pipelines)
Event store for learning, demo and prototyping purposes

## Motivation

This project is created in the context of learning CQRS/ES. It is intentionally separated
from other logic. First, to highlight the role of an event store itself. Second, to be able to
reuse it in different business contexts.
