# Track features

## Decision

We will track features under `docs/features` in files named like this:

```f-001-some-feature.md```

## Alternatives

* Track features using GitHub issues and prioritize with GitHub projects.
* Use PivotalTracker.

While these options are quite flexible and allow managing tasks independently of git log,
they involve additional complexity, specifically binding commits to features.
